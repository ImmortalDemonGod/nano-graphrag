Let me help create a better index.md for your DocInsight documentation, organizing it in a clear and logical structure.





# DocInsight Documentation

## Framework Documentation
- **Core DocInsight Documentation**: Current directory
- **NanoGraphRAG Reference**: Available in separate repository
  - Note: Integration guides, benchmarks, and framework documentation 
    referenced here are part of the base NanoGraphRAG project

## Documentation Scope
This documentation focuses on DocInsight-specific implementation and features. 
For NanoGraphRAG framework documentation, please refer to the NanoGraphRAG 
repository.

## Processing Strategy Documentation
- Query Processing: Types of queries and processing approaches
- Background Tasks: Management of long-running research queries
- Performance Expectations: Query response time guidelines
1. **Project Overview**
   - [Final Pitch](./docinsight-final-pitch.md) - Vision, capabilities, and strategic roadmap
   - [User Stories](./docinsight-user-stories.md) - Detailed feature requirements and acceptance criteria
   - [Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md) - High-level technical architecture and development framework
   - [Query Processing Types and Performance](./query-processing.md) - Detailed classification and optimization strategies

## Technical Documentation
1. **Analysis & Implementation**
   - [Issue Coverage Analysis](./issue-coverage-analysis.md) - Detailed breakdown of NanoGraphRAG capabilities vs. custom development needs
   - [Technical Implementation Guide](./technical-implementation.md) - Concrete implementation patterns and code examples

2. **Setup & Development**
   - [Project Setup Guide](./Project-Setup.md) - Complete environment and development setup instructions

- Core implementation in `/nano_graphrag/`


This index provides:
1. Clear hierarchical organization
2. Direct purpose statements for each document
3. Links to related resources
4. Easy navigation structure
5. Clear separation between different types of documentation

Would you like me to:
1. Add more detail to any section?
2. Reorganize the structure differently?
3. Add additional categories or groupings?
4. Include more specific information about any particular document?
