# DocInsight Revised Implementation Plan

## Timeline Overview
Target MVP Beta: June 1st, 2025
Development Start: December 13th, 2024
Available Development Time: ~5.5 months

## Technical Stack Decisions

### Core Components
1. Vector Database
   - MVP Phase: nano-vectordb
     - Advantages: Simple implementation, fast queries (100ms for 100k vectors)
     - Single dependency (numpy)
     - Easy integration with nanographRAG
   - Production Phase: LanceDB
     - Better scaling capabilities
     - Production-ready features
     - Multi-modal support for future expansion

2. RAG Implementation
   - Base: nanographRAG
   - Key features to implement:
     - Custom query processing
     - Coverage analysis
     - Security implementation
     - Document processing pipeline

3. Development Priorities
   - Test-driven development approach
   - Security-first architecture
   - Scalable component design

## Phase-Based Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Dec 13 - Jan 15)
- Setup development environment
- Implement base nanographRAG integration
- Basic document processing pipeline
- Initial vector storage implementation
- Estimated commits: 600-2000

### Phase 2: Feature Development (Jan 16 - Mar 15)
- Query processing system
- Coverage analysis
- Security implementation
- User management
- Estimated commits: 1800-6000

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Mar 16 - Apr 30)

- Security hardening
- Beta testing preparation
- Estimated commits: 1350-4500

### Phase 4: Beta Preparation (May 1 - June 1)
- Deployment setup
- Final security audit
- User documentation
- Beta user onboarding plan
- Estimated commits: 900-3000

## Security Implementation

### MVP Security Features
1. Access Control
   - MAC address verification
   - Session management
   - User authentication

2. Data Protection
   - Encryption at rest
   - Secure API endpoints
   - Access logging

3. Deployment Security
   - Isolated server environment
   - Network security controls
   - Regular security audits

## Testing Strategy

### Continuous Testing
1. Unit Tests
   - Component-level testing
   - Integration testing
   - Performance benchmarks

2. Security Testing
   - Penetration testing
   - Security audit tools
   - Vulnerability scanning

## Performance Targets

### MVP Phase
- Document processing: < 5 seconds per document
- Query response: < 1 second
- Vector search: < 100ms for 100k vectors
- System uptime: 99%

### Beta Launch Requirements
- Support for 50 concurrent users
- Handle up to 100k documents
- Maintain sub-second query response
- Zero security vulnerabilities

### Project Risks
1. Timeline Pressure
   - Regular progress tracking
   - Priority adjustment
   - Clear MVP scope

2. Integration Challenges
   - Early integration testing
   - Component isolation
   - Clear interfaces

## Success Criteria

### MVP Requirements
